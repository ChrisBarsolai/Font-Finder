# Font-Finder
Intelligent typefont recognition using OCR
Font Finder aims to intelligently recognize fonts used on physical print material or natural scene images, using a smartphone camera

# Description
The project features the development of a library that will detect the font of a text in an image. The library will be accessed via a companion Android application that enables a designer to take pictures using the smartphone camera. The input to the library will be either: an image taken using a camera, a scanned image or a jpeg image, and must contain text.

Text and font recognition will be a combination of OCR, CNNs and deep learning.
